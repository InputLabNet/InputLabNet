# InputLab

Modern software needs robust testing, but traditional test data comes with trade-offs.
- Anonymized production data? Risky and hard to manage.
- Manually crafted test cases? Expensive and time-consuming.

**InputLab** solves this with a smarter approach:
We generate **high-quality**, **fully synthetic** test data tailored to your systems&mdash;fast, effective, and 100% privacy-compliant.

> Test better. Stress less. Enjoy powerful, purpose-built test data.

## 🚀 Why InputLab?

### 1. **Fully Synthetic Test Data**
We produce tailor-made datasets directly from format descriptions like XML schemas or JSON-based API specs.  
✅ No sensitive data involved  
✅ Precision-crafted to fit your system

### 2. **Customized Test Data, On Demand**
You get exactly the test data you need&mdash;nothing more, nothing less.  
Iterate quickly and refine with ease, with support from our team to ensure consistently great results.

### 3. **“Rocket Science” Testing**
Our data systematically explores edge cases and problem zones in your system.  
Whether it's random values, edge cases, or even simulated attack vectors&mdash;**we push your system to its limits before your users do**.

## 🔍 What We Do

InputLab is a **spin-off of the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security** in Saarbrücken.  
Our team has deep roots in academic research and brings that expertise to solve real-world software testing challenges.

We focus on:
- Generating synthetic test data for **structured formats** (like XML, JSON)
- Providing datasets that are **100% schema-conformant**
- Supporting **iterative refinement** based on your testing needs

Our data helps you:
- Identify bugs early
- Avoid compliance risks
- Ship stable, secure software faster

> **We deliver the data. You focus on your customers.**
